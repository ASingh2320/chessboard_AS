-This is a chessboard made in python. You can move pieces as you would with a real life chessboard. The movement of the pieces is built in, 
so if the user does not know how to play chess, they will not be able to move the pieces in an incorrect way. There is also a see possible moves option,
so if the user does not know the possible moves of a piece, it can be shown to them. 
-This is a text based program.
-This program does not yet have the en passant rule which will be added in a future update.
